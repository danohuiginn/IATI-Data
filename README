== IATI Data Visualiser

This is an app to show aid information from the IATI Registry.

== Lots of work needs doing

This is a very early commit and I'm pretty new to Rails so my code is:
a) A bit of a mess
b) Extremely bloated - lots of points where I know things can be done much more easily but I don't know how.

Any help extremely welcome!

== How it works (front-end)

1.       PACKAGES shows you the details of available packages.

 (they are structured by donor >> country/supranational region). 

    [Refresh from IATI Registry] grabs details of five packages (or use ?max=N to pull in N more packages) from the IATI Registry (iatiregistry.org) and makes them available to download.

    [Get Package] next to a package will download it. 

Both of these first steps need to be a lot more automated, but I did it manually to start with for debugging.

2.       ACTIVITIES shows you the activities in a hierarchical way (there are 1st and 2nd-level activities in this data). 

It’s also searchable, although this is quite limited at the moment and navigation doesn't really exist. You can click on some links in the table but some of them go to the activity or the policy marker, and some of them search the data. Which is confusing!

a.       ?sector=1 (whichever sector you’re interested in... probably easiest just to click on Sectors tab and go via there for now)

b.      ?recipient_country_code=GB (2-letter ISO code for whichever country you’re interested in, but obviously depends which packages have been downloaded)

c.      ?recipient_region_code=123 (3-letter DAC region code for whichever region you want, again depends on which packages have been downloaded)

d. 	?implementing_org=Name+of+Implementing+Org (Implementing organisation)

e. 	?status_code=1 (1-4 status code for how complete the project is)

3.       SECTORS shows you the sectors from the activities it’s retrieved so far and how many activities are in each sector

4.       POLICY MARKERS shows you the policy markers from the activities it’s retrieved so far and how many activities are in each policy marker
